# binomial-test

This is a stats engine that carries out hypothesis tests for the binomial distribution, both 1 and 2 tailed.
<br />
<br />
The binomial distribution is as follows:
<br />
$$\text{For the binomial distribution } X \sim B(n,p)$$
<br />
<br />
$$P(X=x) = \frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!} p^n (1-p)^{n-x}$$
<br />

Cumulative Distribution Function
<br />
<br />
$$P(X<=x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!} p^n (1-p)^{n-x}$$

i wrote this latex to make the docs look cool, really and truly theres nothing mathematically exciting going on here, now fuck off
